# Todo Management Application

This is a web-based todo management application built using Spring Boot and React. The application provides secure REST APIs using Spring Security and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Features

- **Server-side**: The server-side of the application is built using Spring Boot and provides secure REST APIs using Spring Security.
- **Register and Login**: The application provides REST APIs for user registration and login. These APIs are secured using JWT.
- **Client-side**: The client-side of the application is built using React and implements the register and login features.
- **Decentralization**: The application has been decentralized into normal users and admin users. Normal users can register for an account, log in, and mark todo tasks as complete or pending. Admin users have all the permissions of normal users, as well as the ability to add, update, and delete tasks.

## Usage

To use the application, simply register for an account as a normal user or log in as an admin user. Once logged in, you can manage your todo tasks by marking them as complete or pending. If you are an admin user, you can also add, update, and delete tasks.
